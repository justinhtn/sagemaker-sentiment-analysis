My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a made for TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated. I am looking forward to seeing this once more, and I hope Patrick Swayze will again look to these type of roles.\n1\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first step in processing the reviews is to make sure that any html tags that appear should be removed.

then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.\n\n## Step 6: Deploy the model for testing\n\nNow that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n\nThere is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored.

However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.\n\nWe will store the code that we write in the `serve` directory. Provided in this directory is the `model.py` file that we used to construct our model, a `utils.py` file which contains the `review_to_words` and `convert_and_pad` pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and `predict.py`, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that `requirements.txt` is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.\n\nWhen deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.\n - `model_fn`: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.\n - `input_fn`: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.\n - `output_fn`: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.\n - `predict_fn`: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.\n\nFor the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the `input_fn` and `output_fn` methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.\n\n### (TODO) Writing

What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.\n\n<img src=\"Web App Diagram.svg\">\n\nThe diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.\n\nIn the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.\n\nLastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.\n\n### Setting up a Lambda function\n\nThe first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.\n\n#### Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function\n\nSince we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.\n\nUsing the AWS Console, navigate to the **IAM** page and click on **Roles**. Then, click on **Create role**. Make sure that the **AWS service** is the type of trusted entity selected and choose **Lambda** as the service that will use this role, then click **Next: Permissions**.\n\nIn the search box type `sagemaker` and select the check box next to the **AmazonSageMakerFullAccess** policy. Then, click on **Next: Review**.\n\nLastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example `LambdaSageMakerRole`. Then, click on **Create role**.\n\n#### Part B: Create a Lambda function\n\nNow it is time to actually create the Lambda function.\n\nUsing the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on **Create a function**. When you get to the next page, make sure that **Author from scratch** is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example `sentiment_analysis_func`. Make sure that the **Python 3.6** runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on **Create Function**.\n\nOn the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below. \n\n```python\n# We need to use the low-level library to interact with SageMaker since the SageMaker API\n# is not available natively through Lambda.\nimport boto3\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n\n    # The SageMaker runtime is what allows us to invoke the endpoint that we've created.\n    runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')\n\n    # Now we use the SageMaker runtime to invoke our endpoint, sending the review we were given\n    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = '**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**',    # The name of the endpoint we created\n                                       ContentType = 'text/plain',                 # The data format that is expected\n                                       Body = event['body'])                       # The actual review\n\n    # The response is an HTTP response whose body contains the result of our inference\n    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')\n\n    return {\n        'statusCode' : 200,\n        'headers' : { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' },\n        'body' : result\n    }\n```\n\nOnce you have copy and pasted the code above into the Lambda code editor, replace the `**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**` portion with the name of the endpoint that we deployed earlier. You can determine the name of the endpoint using the code cell below.","metadata":{"cell_id":"6ee7b37a-b625-4138-9b88-6a790e403798"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"bff54c8c-45fa-4712-8a36-b0120b4a65d3"},"source":"predictor.endpoint","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Once you have added the endpoint name to the Lambda function, click on **Save**. Your Lambda function is now up and running. Next we need to create a way for our web app to execute the Lambda function.\n\n### Setting up API Gateway\n\nNow that our Lambda function is set up, it is time to create a new API using API Gateway that will trigger the Lambda function we have just created.\n\nUsing AWS Console, navigate to **Amazon API Gateway** and then click on **Get started**.\n\nOn the next page, make sure that **New API** is selected and give the new api a name, for example, `sentiment_analysis_api`. Then, click on **Create API**.\n\nNow we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.\n\nSelect the **Actions** dropdown menu and click **Create Method**. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select **POST**, then click on the check mark beside it.\n\nFor the integration point, make sure that **Lambda Function** is selected and click on the **Use Lambda Proxy integration**. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.\n\nType the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the **Lambda Function** text entry box and then click on **Save**. Click on **OK** in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.\n\nThe last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the **Actions** dropdown and click on **Deploy API**. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example `prod`.\n\nYou have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text **Invoke URL**.","metadata":{"cell_id":"c84ed110-a7cd-4ec5-9f8f-62198b80a2ee"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 4: Deploying our web app\n\nNow that we have a publicly available API, we can start using it in a web app. For our purposes, we have provided a simple static html file which can make use of the public api you created earlier.\n\nIn the `website` folder there should be a file called `index.html`. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains **\\*\\*REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL\\*\\***. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.\n\nNow, if you open `index.html` on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.\n\nIf you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3.
